# 🌟 Tata Forage Data Science Virtual Experience Program

Welcome to my submission for the **Tata Data Science Virtual Experience Program on Forage**. This project simulates a real-world case study where I, as a data scientist, help a fictional company (PowerCo) investigate customer churn through data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning.

## 🧠 Project Tasks & Deliverables

### ✅ Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loaded and examined three datasets: customer data, pricing data, and churn indicators.
- Analyzed data types, missing values, and distributions.
- Generated summary statistics and visualizations to understand trends and data quality.

📎 Output: `Powerco_eda_analysis.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Task 2: Feature Engineering
- Removed redundant and irrelevant columns.
- Created meaningful new features such as:
  - `total_variable_price`
  - `total_fixed_price`
  - `price_ratio_var_to_fix`
- Prepared the dataset (`engineered_data.csv`) for modeling.

📎 Output: `Powerco_feature_engineering.ipynb`

---

### ✅ Task 3: Churn Prediction Model
- Loaded the final dataset (`data_for_predictions.csv`) provided post-feature engineering.
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier** using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
- Justified metric choice and assessed model performance.

📎 Output: `Powerco_churn_prediction_random_forest.ipynb`

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric     | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy   | Overall correctness of predictions                                          |
| Precision  | Focuses on how many predicted churners were actual churners                |
| Recall     | Focuses on catching all actual churners                                    |
| F1 Score   | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall – useful for imbalanced datasets     |
